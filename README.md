This version of the Neuromatch course incorporates [Chatify](https://github.com/ContextLab/chatify) ðŸ¤– functionality. This is an experimental extension that adds support for a large language model-based helper to the some of the tutorial materials. Instructions for using the Chatify extension are provided in the relevant tutorial notebooks.  Note that using the extension may cause breaking changes and/or provide incorrect or misleading information.

Thanks for giving Chatify a try! Love it? Hate it? Either way, we'd love to hear from you about your Chatify experience!  Please consider filling out our [brief survey](https://forms.gle/jNq85KVvNwj1JHZV9) to provide feedback and help us make Chatify more awesome!
